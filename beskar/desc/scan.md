<h2>About Scanning</h2>

<p>Scanning is the most crucial portion of the work involved with the SEAL kit. Scanning allows one to determine how well the given samples catalyzes the reaction of creating oxygen from water.</p>

<p>Before performing a scan make sure the FTO (fluorine-tin oxide) plate is setup correctly in the glass bowl. For information on how to do that see <a style="color: {}; text-decoration: none" href="https://www.notion.so/Testing-a-Plate-c89e93b206d74cbba8a8eca2605be462#4e1335f53f764527a14e2089e86d3f7c">this link</a>. Once the FTO plate is setup, scanning can begin, given the dark current is at an appropriate level.  Generally, it is a good idea to do conduct at least 2 scans to make sure the results are consistent results and not one-off flukes. A scan takes around 1 minute to complete.  Once a scan is completed, the scan results can be saved to a <code>.csv</code> file. <code>.csv</code> files are a table based file format and can be open in Microsoft Excel or in Google Sheets.

<p>The bar chart can be nagivated in two ways, zooming in and out, and by rotation.  To zoom in move the scroll wheel up on a mouse.  To zoom out move the scroll down on a mouse.  To rotate the bar chart, right click and hold, and drag the mouse. The exact value of a peak can be seen by left clicking the peak.</p>

<p>Interpreting a scan is generally as simple as looking for the highest peak in the results.  If a peak is high consistently across all or most scans this is a strong indication this element or combination of elements is particularly good at catalyzing the water to oxygen reaction.</p>
