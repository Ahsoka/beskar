<h2>About Dark Current</h2>
<p>The dark current page displays the dark current reading from the SEAL kit</p>

<p>Dark current readings should be below 0.5 volts.  Periodically check the dark current values by refreshing the dark current readings by clicking the <b>Refresh</b> button in bottom left corner of the scatter plot.  The exact value of a reading can be seen by hovering the mouse over a point (note that this feature can be buggy and the reading may only be displayed for a few seconds). Sometimes it can take between 1 and 10 minutes for dark current values to stabilize to below the 0.5 volts thresho;d.  If the dark current is still above the 0.5 volts threshold then try reducing the applied voltage using the <b>Apply Voltage</b> page.</p>

High dark current decreases the signal-to-noise ratio during the experiment	that forms the	basis of the results obtained from the SEAL kit. So the lower the dark current, the better the results from the <b>Scan</b> page will be. Additionally, if the dark current values are extremely high, this may indicate something is wrong with the SEAL kit and program will generate a warning message indicating so.

<!-- Might want to add a section explaining what exactly dark current is. -->
