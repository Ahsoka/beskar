<p>Mocked mode allows you to use this software without needing to connect a SEAL kit to your computer.  The program will generate fake values in place of the values that would normally be received from the SEAL kit.<p>

<p>The next two pages do not actually do anything but they simulate what you would need to do in the event you actually had a SEAL kit connected.</p>

<p><b>You don't need ANY drivers</b> to run this program when using mocked mode.</p>
