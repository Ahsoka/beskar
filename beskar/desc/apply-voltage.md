<h2>About Applying Voltage</h2>
<p>The Apply Voltage page allows you to apply a voltage using the SEAL kit.</p>

<p>Applying voltage is as simple as dragging the slider or typing a value and clicking the <b>Apply</b> button.  In most situations you will want to apply 0.1 volts.  Once you click <b>Apply</b>, the applied voltage should appear on the multimeter you have connected to the SEAL kit.  If the <b>Apply</b> button is grayed out this means the given value is the current voltage applied.  Additionally, when trying to apply voltages on either extreme of slider, a message will appear indicating that the SEAL kit may not be able to apply voltages at the given extreme accurately.</p>

<p>Applying voltage is important for initiating an experiment. Increasing the voltage is like increasing the water pressure in a hose. The higher you turn the water pressure (voltage), the more water (current) will flow. Applying a voltage can help "push" along reactions by applying a "pressure" that makes the reaction move forward.</p>
